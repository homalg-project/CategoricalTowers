The package `CatReps` provides a constructor for *finite concrete categories* (i.e., finite subcategories of the category of finite sets) by generating morphisms:

```gap
gap> LoadPackage( "CatReps" );
true
gap> c3c3 := ConcreteCategoryForCAP( [ [2,3,1], [4,5,6], [,,,5,6,4] ] );
A finite concrete category
gap> mors := SetOfGeneratingMorphisms( c3c3 );
[ A morphism in subcategory given by: <A morphism in FinSets>,
  A morphism in subcategory given by: <A morphism in FinSets>,
  A morphism in subcategory given by: <A morphism in FinSets> ]
gap> Perform( mors, Display );
A morphism in subcategory given by: [ [ 1, 2, 3 ], [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 2, 3 ], [ 3, 1 ] ], [ 1, 2, 3 ] ]
A morphism in subcategory given by: [ [ 1, 2, 3 ], [ [ 1, 4 ], [ 2, 5 ], [ 3, 6 ] ], [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]
A morphism in subcategory given by: [ [ 4, 5, 6 ], [ [ 4, 5 ], [ 5, 6 ], [ 6, 4 ] ], [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]
```

Using the procedure `Algebroid` one can then construct a finite presentation of the k-linear closure of the given concrete category. The current preliminary implementation only works when the endomorphism monoids of the concrete category are explicitly cyclic:

```gap
gap> Q := HomalgFieldOfRationals( );
GF(3)
gap> A := Algebroid( Q, c3c3 );
Algebroid generated by the right quiver q(2)[a:1->1,b:1->2,c:2->2]
gap> UnderlyingQuiverAlgebra( A );
(Q * q) / [ 1*(a*a*a) - 1*(1), 1*(c*c*c) - 1*(2), -1*(b*c) + 1*(a*b) ]
gap> IsLinearClosureOfACategory( A );
true
```

Finally, using the constructor `Hom` from the package [`FunctorCategories`](https://github.com/homalg-project/FunctorCategories) one can construct the category of finite dimensional k-linear representations of the finite concrete category:

```gap
gap> CatReps := FunctorCategory( A, Q );
FunctorCategory( Algebroid generated by the right quiver
q(2)[a:1->1,b:1->2,c:2->2] -> Category of matrices over Q )
```

The supported categorical doctrine of the category of representations is

* k-linear,
* symmetric monoidal,
* Abelian category
* with enough projectives, and
* (possibly incomplete) direct sum decomposition.

```gap
gap> InfoOfInstalledOperationsOfCategory( CatReps );
99 primitive operations were used to derive 318 operations for this category
which constructively
* IsEquippedWithHomomorphismStructure
* IsLinearCategoryOverCommutativeRing
* IsSymmetricMonoidalCategory
* IsAbelianCategory
gap> CommutativeRingOfLinearCategory( CatReps );
Q
```

### `FunctorCategories`

`CatReps` heavily relies on the package [`FunctorCategories`](https://github.com/homalg-project/FunctorCategories), which itself depends on [various other packages](https://github.com/homalg-project/CatReps/blob/master/.github/workflows/Tests.yml#L25).

### History of this package

`CatReps` was originally meant to wrap [Peter Webb](https://www-users.math.umn.edu/~webb/)'s pre-package [`catreps`](https://www-users.math.umn.edu/~webb/GAPfiles/catreps) into the categorical framework offered by [`CAP`](https://homalg-project.github.io/docs/CAP_project/). The only dependency left can be found in the file [gap/catreps.g](https://codecov.io/gh/homalg-project/CatReps/src/master/gap/catreps.g). The entire functionality of [`catreps`](https://www-users.math.umn.edu/~webb/GAPfiles/catreps) is now available through [`FunctorCategories`](https://homalg-project.github.io/pkg/FunctorCategories).

In March 2020 [Peter Webb](https://www-users.math.umn.edu/~webb/)' and his coauthors made a major new release of the former packages `reps` and `catreps` in which they are combined as one. The code of these former packages is still available at [`groupreps`](https://www-users.math.umn.edu/~webb/GAPfiles/groupreps) ([tutorial](https://www-users.math.umn.edu/~webb/GAPfiles/grouprepstutorial.html)) (the new name for the former reps) and [`catreps`](https://www-users.math.umn.edu/~webb/GAPfiles/catreps) ([tutorial](https://www-users.math.umn.edu/~webb/GAPfiles/catrepstutorial.html)), but it will no longer be supported. The new package [`reps`](https://www-users.math.umn.edu/~webb/GAPfiles/reps) combines the functionality of both former packages.
